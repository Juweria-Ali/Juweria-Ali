## [Project 1: Building-a-dashboard-for-STEM-subject-entrants-in-Higher-Education-and-Further-Education](https://github.com/Juweria-Ali/Building-a-dashboard-for-STEM-subject-entrants-in-Higher-Education-and-Further-Education)
This is a project I did as Data Intern for the University of Highlands and Islands as partof my Data Science Master's program.
Aim:
The purpose of this project phase is to design, implement, and evaluate a prototype self-service
dashboard to help STEM providers in the Highlands and Islands STEM Partnership plan activities,
understand enrolments in STEM subject entrants at college and forecast future trends.
Objectives
1. Investigate the availability & viability of data sources for inclusion in the visualisations.
2. Review state of the art in data visualisation dashboards including available software tools.
3. Create an efficient and usable data visualization.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness in terms of usability & accuracy.
Data Sources:
1. Skills Development Scotland (SDS) RSA Data Matrix
2. Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA)
3. Scottish Funding Council (SFC) Data
4. Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) Data
Overview of the project with figures is published as poster in pdf format.
The complete write up is available as a project report in pdf format.

## [Project 2: Classification of Medical X-ray images of different body parts using Python](https://github.com/Juweria-Ali/Machine-Learning-using-Python)
Data Compilation:
The images were downloaded from three different URL and the dataset consists of 4331 x-ray images.
1. Chest images were downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 2366 images were randomly taken from the two directories.
2. Knee images were downloaded from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/t9ndx37v5h/1. 1124 images were randomly taken from the two directories.
3. Shoulder images were downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/dryari5/shoulder-xray-classification.The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Type A1, C1, D1 and Others). There are 841 Shoulder X-Ray images (PNG) and 4 categories (Type A1, C1, D1 and Others).

## [Project 3: Data cleaning, preparation,EDA and initial analysis using Excel and R](https://github.com/Juweria-Ali/Data-Cleaning-Data-Merging-EDA-and-initial-analysis-using-R-on-Events-and-Weather-datasets)
Prepare and explore the datasets, perform data cleaning, data transformation and data exploration prior to performing learning tasks.
